# Ecommerce Angular App

This is a mini Angular app that uses public `Fake Store API` to fetch the product list and `Firebase realtime database` 
to store product purchase data

## Available Scripts

I recommend to use `yarn` as package manager due to its better dependency resolution

- execute `yarn` to install the dependencies
- execute `yarn start` to run the application at localhost
